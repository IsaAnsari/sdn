Step 1: Open Cisco Packet Tracer, go to Network devices > Routers > add 3 routers of 1841.
Step 2: Now click on Router0 > Switch off the button > add WIC-2T > Switch On. Do the
        same for remaining Routers.
Step 3: Go to Connections > select Serial DCE and connect the routers with serial 0/0/0 to serial 0/0/1.
Step 4: Go to End Devices > add 1 PC to each router.
Step 5: Go to Connections > choose first wire > connect Router to PC.
Step 6: Assigning IP address to serial, click on router > config > serial port > checkbox on >
        clock rate to 64000 then assign IP address and for fastEathernet, click on router > config >
        fastEathernet port > checkbox on then assign IP address.
Step 7: Assigning IP address to PCs, click on PC > Desktop > IP Configuration > assign IP
        address and Default Gateway (i.e. the fastEathernet IP connected to the switch), then the
        final topology with IP addresses will look like:
Step 8: To implement BGP, click on Respective Routers then go to CLI tab then execute
        commands run commands with their respective routers:

          network 50.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0
          exit

PC 1: ping 50.0.0.2
